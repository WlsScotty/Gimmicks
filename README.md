Basic fun conceptual codes, they provide limited functionality, but these programs were made with simply composing a fun gimmick in mind.

I sorted all the gimmicks in folders, starting at programming language used, then the size of how big the project itself was to compose, then it has the code inside of the said project.

NOTE: These would DEFINENTLY NOT be production line code. The lack of inherent exception handling coupled with the limited amount of conditions across devices makes this code more suit to fun little, as for mentioned, gimmicks.
